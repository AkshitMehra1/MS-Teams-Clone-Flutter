## Conclusion

It was a very exciting month for me and I am very happy to say that I created my own Microsoft Teams Clone which works. However being restricted in time due to college exams the app wasn't fully done but it was 90% complete at the time of submittion. Nevertheless it was a profound effort from my side and I am happy the way it turned out. 
If you found any issues while running my app please contact me or raise an issue on github.
This app will still be in development and I will continue working on it and making it better.

## Additional Feature list to be added in the future
